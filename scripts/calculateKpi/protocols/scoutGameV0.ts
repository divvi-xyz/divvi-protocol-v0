/**
 * Calculates transaction count for Scout Game V0 user engagement tracking.
 *
 * **KPI Unit**: Transaction count (number of transactions)
 *
 * **Business Purpose**: Measures the number of transactions initiated by a specific user across multiple
 * networks supported by Scout Game V0. This metric quantifies user engagement and activity level
 * with the Scout Game ecosystem, supporting user behavior analysis and engagement tracking.
 *
 * **Protocol Context**: Scout Game V0 is a gamified platform that tracks and rewards user activity
 * across multiple blockchain networks. Transaction count serves as a key metric for measuring user
 * participation and engagement with the Scout Game ecosystem and supported protocols.
 *
 * **Supported Networks**: Base, Celo, Polygon
 *
 * **Data Sources**:
 * - **HyperSync**: Transaction data from Base, Celo, and Polygon networks via HyperSync clients
 * - **Block Data**: Timestamps via `getBlockRange` utility for temporal filtering across all networks
 *
 * **Business Assumptions**:
 * - Transaction count accurately represents user engagement across supported networks
 * - All user-initiated transactions contribute equally to engagement metrics regardless of network or value
 * - Cross-network transaction aggregation provides comprehensive view of user activity
 * - Higher transaction counts indicate more active participation in the Scout Game ecosystem
 * - Both successful and failed transactions represent legitimate user engagement attempts
 *
 * **Activity Types**: Token transfers, DeFi interactions, NFT transactions, smart contract calls, and protocol usage
 *
 * **Calculation Method**:
 * 1. Iterates through all supported networks (Base, Celo, Polygon)
 * 2. For each network, queries all transactions initiated by user wallet within the time window
 * 3. Filters transactions by block timestamp to ensure they fall within the specified time range
 * 4. Aggregates transaction counts across all networks
 * 5. Returns total cross-network transaction count representing user's Scout Game engagement
 *
 * @param params - Calculation parameters
 * @param params.address - User wallet address to calculate transaction count for
 * @param params.startTimestamp - Start of time window for transaction counting (inclusive)
 * @param params.endTimestampExclusive - End of time window for transaction counting (exclusive)
 *
 * @returns Promise resolving to total number of transactions across all supported networks

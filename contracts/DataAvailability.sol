  /**
     * @dev DataAvailability stores information about the objective function value for users
     * across timestamps.
     * 
     * The contract owner and any permitted uploaders may upload user objective function data
     * at a given timestamp. The objective function data that are uploaded represent the delta
     * between the objective function value at the current timestamp and the value at the
     * previous timestamp that data was uploaded. The data is not actually stored in the contract,
     * but events are emitted for each upload, which can be used to reconstruct the full data history.
     *
     * Instead of storing all data in the contract, a rolling hash of the data is calculated and stored
     * for each timestamp. When verifying the data, the submitted proof will contain a hash of the data
     * computed in a trusted zkVM; if the hash contained in the proof matches the hash stored in the contract,
     * the data is considered valid.

     * The rolling hash is calculated by summing the existing hash for a given timestamp with the hash of each
     * user:value pair modulo 2^256 as they are received by the contract. Since modular addition is both commutative and associative, this
     * results in a hash that is invariant to the order of uploads. Since we cannot "remove" information about
     * a data entry from the hash, we require that information about a user:value pair is only submitted once
     * per timestamp, to ensure that the hash is correct.
     *
     * The intended usage pattern of this contract is as follows:
     * - For a given timestamp t_1, changes in objective function values since the last timestamp t_0 are calculated.
     * - These data are submitted to the contract, and a rolling hash is calculated.
     * - The contract emits events for each upload, which can be used to reconstruct the full data history.
     * - These data are used by an off-chain reward distribution service to calculate rewards owed for the
     *   period between t_0 and t_1.
